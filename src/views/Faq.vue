                    With the artist advance fund, you will be able to access your advances
                    from a one stop dashboard (advance.ejoya.co) where your applications can be made. Repayment will
                    be made on a monthly basis with a pre-agreed flat fee till the advance is paid off in its
                    entirety. Like our operations, each advance will be dynamic with the length of repayment and the
                    percentage of income set aside for repayment.

                    When you agree to an advance, a payback contribution percentage is
                    fixed. We will deduct the set percentage from your earning and pay you the rest. Financial
                    statements will be sent to you monthly
